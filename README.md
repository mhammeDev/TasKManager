# TasKManager
This Java application serves as a training ground for improving my skills in this languagage, as the best way to learn is through hands-on experience.

## The goal is to implement all of theses functions :
- **To do-list** : Post a to-do list. Each task should have a title, description, due date (optional) and status (to be done, in progress, completed, etc.).
- **Add tasks** : Users should be abble to add new tasks to the do-list: when they add a task, they can specify the title, description and optionally a due date.
- **Update the state** : Users should be able mark a task as complete or change its status with a checkbox or similar action
- **Modifying task** : Users should be able to edit the title, the description, the due taks of an existing task.
- **Removing task** : Users should be able to remove a task from the to-do list when they no longer want to keep it.
- **Filter of the tasks** : Users should be able to filter the task with the status (to do, in progress, completed) or with the due date.
- **Search of a task** : Users should be able to search for a task with a keyword in the title or description
- **Storage of the data** : The to-do list needed to be saved, to maintain the task between sessions.
- **Add a user account (optionnal)** : Add a login and signup feature to allow users to save their to-do list.
